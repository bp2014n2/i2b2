Mrs. Doe is a 72 yr. F who walks in.

HPI: 
1. Hypertension: I have not seen her for over a year. She has spent most of her time with Dr. Lahive (pulmonary) and her respiratory status. She says she saw Dr. Lahive today and when they took her blood pressure they told her to rush right over here. She says she has been faithfully taking her Nifedipine XL and Atenolol.
2. Hypoxia/COPD: See previous notes-she had a hypoxic event March 2001 with hallucinations. After that then her O2 sats. were over 90%, without treatment essentially (she did not use her inhalers). On her  visit in Jan. 03 her O2 sat was in the 88-90% range. I asked her to use her inhalers faithfully and RTC. Her sat. on return was still upper 80's. I referred her to Dr. Lahive (pulmonary) who put her on Advair and again recommended she use supplemental O2. She is now on Advair and Combivent and continuous NC O2.
